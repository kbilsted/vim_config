# Vimium browser plugin key mappings
#
# by Kasper B. Graversen, 2024

#
# design philosophy 
#   o existing mappings are really good
#   o prefer non-shift over shift bindings
#   o prefer frequent used operations on left hand 
#     - (easy to reach when using a mouse)

# we unmap these as otherwise it is difficult to select stuff with shift and j/k - as it change tab
unmap J
unmap K

map w nextTab
map e visitPreviousTab
map b previousTab

map ' Marks.activateGotoMode

# (a)mmend urlmap ' Marks.activateGotoMode
map a Vomnibar.activateEditUrl

# more of existing mappings 
map D scrollFullPageDown
map U scrollFullPageUp

# (g)o (b)ookmarks - more rare than going back tab
map gb Vomnibar.activateBookmarks


# available non-shift keys 
map . goForward
map , goBack

# non-US keyboard mappings to same spot as on US keyboard
map - enterFindMode
